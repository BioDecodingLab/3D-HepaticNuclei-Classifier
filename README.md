# 3D-HepaticNuclei-Classifier
A reproducible pipeline for 3D hepatic nucleus classification using self-supervised 3DINO embeddings and supervised machine learning.

## Overview

This repository implements a 3D nuclear morphotype classification pipeline based on:

- **Self-supervised feature extraction:** 3DINO embeddings  
- **Nucleus instance preparation:** bounding-box (3D crop) extraction  
- **Downstream classifiers:** Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Logistic Regression (LR)  
- **Data:** 3D microscopy volumes of mouse liver tissue

The goal is to evaluate how well self-supervised **3D embeddings** support downstream classification of **hepatic nuclear morphotypes**.

This repository accompanies the thesis work:  
**“Automated Classification of Hepatic 3D Nuclear Morphotypes Using Self-Supervised 3DINO Embeddings” (2026)**.


## Key Features

* 3D nucleus preprocessing (bounding boxes, normalization)

* Self-supervised 3DINO embedding extraction

* Multiple classifier options (RF, SVM, MLP, LR)

* Hyperparameter optimization experiments

* Evaluation metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score

* Configurable training pipeline

* Reproducible experiments using fixed seeds

* Lightweight and easy to extend for new tissues or modalities


## Current Research Notes

* Performance limitations observed between Stellate, Kupffer and Endothelial classes.

* Hyperparameter tuning of Random Forest did not significantly outperform baseline.

* Potential domain shift between 3DINO pretraining data and hepatic confocal volumes.

* Data augmentation strategies under review (visual verification pending).

* Ongoing evaluation of excluding heterogeneous “Other” class for ablation analysis.

## Running the project (Execution order)

The notebooks are numbered and must be executed in order:

**Notebook 1 — Data preprocessing**

Loads the raw 3D volumes

Applies the required preprocessing (e.g., normalization + crop/pad to the target size)

Saves the processed dataset ready for embedding extraction

**Notebook 2 — Embedding extraction (3DINO / ViT features)**

Loads the preprocessed volumes from Notebook 1

Albumentations and Extracts embeddings 

Saves embeddings

**Notebook 3 — Random Forest classifier**

Loads the embeddings from Notebook 2

Trains and evaluates the Random Forest model

Reports metrics (e.g., accuracy / F1 / confusion matrix) and saves the trained model if configured

## Dependencies and versions
